Yourself a Whiskey or Scotch - Cocktails in the Afternoon Series - printed on Vintage Dictionary Paper - 8x10.5 - dictionary art print","description":":: DESCRIPTION ::\nCocktails in the Afternoon Series printed on vintage dictionary paper. These vintage book prints make awesome unique gifts and are environmentally responsible. \n\nEach print is on a different page of vintage dictionary paper, so no two are exactly alike. One of the great things about prints on antique book pages is not only the beauty and making for an interesting read but it also upcycles books giving them new life. In the spirit of recycling we use book pages for our prints that may have character flaws with some spotting, uneven printing and occasional corner bending. All our dictionary pages have that beautiful golden patina color that only comes from age. The result is a unique and absolutely beautiful print suitable for framing. These prints are definite conversation starters and look gorgeous while hanging on the wall.\n\n\n:: PAPER SIZE ::\nPaper is approximately 8\u201d x 10 1\/2\u201d in size, with a very slight variation, perfect for an 8x10 frame or a standard 11x14 mat with an opening for an 8x10 print.\n\n\n:: SHIPPING ::\nThe print will be packaged in a clear plastic sleeve and a sturdy cardboard mailer for shipping via USPS First Class Mail. Orders are mailed within 1-3 business days after payment. \n\n\n:: UPGRADES ::\nCanvas reproductions available here:\nwww.etsy.com\/listing\/102089382\n\n\n:: NOTES :: \nItems do not come matted and do not come in frame.
