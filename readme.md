Etsy Project:
1) Created a new web page based on Etsy.com site
2) built HTML and styled with CSS file.
3) Used Javascript functions and template literal to sort Etsy product data, then append to the "container" div various pieces of data, such as .png file, product title, price, and source.  Web page was built dynamically in this way to display 16 products in tiled format.  
4) See this beautiful rendition at:
